# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this project I used moment, bootstrap, and jquery to make a workday schedule. It is designed to show different colors depending on if the specific time of that time block has passed, is the current time, or you still have that timeblock available. It also is responsive to refreshing the page, so that if a user accidentally refreshes their data is still there for them. The webpage also saves the event into the local storage after a user clicks the save button at the end of the time block.
